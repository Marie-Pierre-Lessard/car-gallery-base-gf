/* If one creates a CSS rule for the element "section", it initially appears to work because there are two sections inside of another section, which all become grids. The sections that are children are put inside the parent grid, in different columns. The problem is that the parent grid needs to have a different number of columns. If it has 3 columns, there is one empty column that gets created at the end, but that empty column was hard to see, so it looked like it wasn't there. */
